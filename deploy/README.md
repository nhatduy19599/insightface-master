InsightFace deployment README
---

For insightface pip-package <= 0.1.5, we use MXNet as inference backend, please download all models from [onedrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AswpsDO2toNKrUy0VktHTWgIQ0bn?e=UEF7C4), and put them all under `~/.insightface/models/` directory.

Starting from insightface>=0.2, we use onnxruntime as inference backend, please download our **antelope** model release from [onedrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AswpsDO2toNKrU0ydGgDkrHPdJ3m?e=iVgZox), and put it under `~/.insightface/models/`, so there're onnx models at `~/.insightface/models/antelope/*.onnx`.

The **antelope** model release contains `ResNet100@Glint360K recognition model` and `SCRFD-10GF detection model`. Please check `test.py` for detail.
