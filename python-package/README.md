## Python package of insightface README


For insightface pip-package <= 0.1.5, we use MXNet as inference backend, please download all models from [onedrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AswpsDO2toNKrUy0VktHTWgIQ0bn?e=UEF7C4), and put them all under `~/.insightface/models/` directory.

Starting from insightface>=0.2, we use onnxruntime as inference backend.
